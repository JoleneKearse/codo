# Codo: A Todo List for Devs

## Purpose

I know - another **Todo List** done in **JavaScript**! 

I primarily want to practice **testing**, both *unit tests* and *DOM simulation*, in a **TDD** format, so I decided to keep things as simple as possible.  

Recently I skimmed a YouTube video, where the dev recreated a terminal look on the web.  I thought both:
- that looks cool, and
- that would be fun to style up!

## MVP for app
 
- [ ] Cool terminal interface
- [ ] Ability to add task
- [ ] Users can view tasks
- [ ] Tasks are filterable based on category, completed, etc.
- [ ] Users can marks tasks as complete
- [ ] Tasks are deletable
